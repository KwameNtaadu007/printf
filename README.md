**0x11. C - printf**
This is a collaborative project to build a custom printf function.

The printf() function is a standard library function in the C 
programming language that allows you to output formatted text
to the console or to a file. 
It is commonly used to display messages, variables, 
and other information during program execution.

You can use various format specifiers to format 
the output of printf(), such as %d for integers, %f 
for floating-point numbers, %s for strings, and %c 
for individual characters. You can also use flags 
and modifiers to control the width,
precision, and alignment of the output.
